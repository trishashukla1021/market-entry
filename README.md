Market entry analysis
This project is based on an example of ABG Motors, a successful Japanese car manufacturer,
considering entry into the Indian market, which seeks to confirm profitability similarities with Japan.
The company sees India as a key opportunity to expand its sales; it has been tracking the Indian
market for over a few years. ABG Motors believes that the Indian market is quite similar to the
Japanese market where the company currently operates. Before entering the new market, the
company wants to ensure the whole process will be profitable. Hence, you are tasked with ensuring the forecast of a minimum of 12,000 car sales over the sample data in one year.
